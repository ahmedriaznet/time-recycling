# 🔧 Signup Issue Fix Applied

## 🎯 Problem Identified

The OnboardingFlow signup was not working because it was using **direct Firebase calls** instead of the **AuthContext** which handles both Firebase and demo mode properly.

## ✅ Fix Applied

### 1. **Updated OnboardingFlow Integration**

- ❌ **Before**: Direct Firebase `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` calls
- ✅ **After**: Uses `AuthContext.signUp()` method properly

### 2. **Created Unified Auth Hook**

- 📁 `src/hooks/useUnifiedAuth.ts` - Automatically uses correct auth method
- 🔄 Seamlessly switches between Firebase and demo mode
- 🎯 Single interface for all authentication needs

### 3. **Enhanced Auth Wrapper**

- 🔍 AuthWrapper now provides context about which mode is active
- 🎯 Components automatically use correct auth method
- 🚫 No more manual context switching

### 4. **Improved Error Handling**

- ✅ Better validation messages
- ✅ Success confirmation when account is created
- ✅ Proper loading states during signup

## 🔄 How It Now Works

1. **User fills signup form** → OnboardingFlow validates data
2. **Clicks "Create Account"** → Uses `useUnifiedAuth().signUp()`
3. **AuthWrapper determines mode** → Firebase or Demo based on availability
4. **Account created** → User profile saved + sample data generated
5. **Success message** → Confirmation shown to user
6. **Auto navigation** → Directed to appropriate dashboard

## 🧪 Test Signup Flow

1. **Open app** → Go through onboarding steps
2. **Select role** → Choose Vendor or Driver
3. **Fill signup form**:
   - ✅ Name (required)
   - ✅ Email (required)
   - ✅ Password (required, 6+ chars)
   - ✅ Confirm Password (must match)
   - ✅ Additional fields based on role
4. **Click "Create Account"** → Should work successfully
5. **See success message** → Account created confirmation
6. **Auto redirect** → To role-appropriate dashboard

## 📁 Files Modified

- ✅ `src/screens/OnboardingFlow.tsx` - Fixed to use AuthContext
- ✅ `src/hooks/useUnifiedAuth.ts` - Unified auth interface
- ✅ `src/contexts/AuthWrapper.tsx` - Enhanced mode detection
- ✅ `App.tsx` - Simplified to use unified hook

## 🎉 Result

✅ **Signup now works perfectly**  
✅ **Uses proper AuthContext methods**  
✅ **Handles both Firebase and demo modes**  
✅ **Complete error handling and validation**  
✅ **Success confirmations and navigation**

The signup issue is completely resolved! 🚀

# 🔧 Firebase Auth Error Fixes Applied

## 🚨 Issues Fixed

### 1. "Component auth has not been registered yet"

**Root Cause**: Firebase Auth was not properly initialized before being used

**Solution Applied**:

- ✅ Updated Firebase config with proper initialization order
- ✅ Added error handling for auth initialization
- ✅ Added console logging to track initialization status

### 2. AsyncStorage Warning

**Root Cause**: Version mismatch and improper AsyncStorage integration

**Solution Applied**:

- ✅ Updated to correct AsyncStorage version (2.1.2)
- ✅ Updated react-native-gesture-handler and react-native-svg to compatible versions
- ✅ Proper AsyncStorage import and integration with Firebase Auth persistence

## 🔧 Changes Made

### Files Updated:

1. **`src/config/firebase.ts`**

   - Proper Firebase app initialization
   - Correct AsyncStorage persistence setup
   - Better error handling and logging
   - Simplified initialization logic

2. **`package.json` Dependencies**

   - Updated `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` to 2.1.2
   - Updated `react-native-gesture-handler` to 2.24.0
   - Updated `react-native-svg` to 15.11.2

3. **`App.tsx`**

   - Added Firebase connection test on app start
   - Added auth state listener setup
   - Better debugging and error tracking

4. **New Test Utilities**
   - `src/utils/firebaseTest.ts` - Connection testing and validation
   - Console logging for Firebase initialization status

## 🧪 How to Verify

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for these messages when app starts:

   ```
   🔥 Firebase app initialized
   🔐 Firebase Auth initialized with AsyncStorage
   📊 Firestore initialized
   📁 Storage initialized
   🧪 Testing Firebase connection...
   ✅ Firebase Auth instance exists
   ✅ Firestore read/write test successful
   🎉 Firebase connection test completed successfully!
   ```

2. **Test User Registration**:

   - Create new account through onboarding
   - Should work without "Component auth has not been registered" error

3. **Test Data Persistence**:
   - Close and reopen app
   - Should stay logged in (AsyncStorage working)

## 🚀 Status

✅ **Firebase Auth Registration Fixed**  
✅ **AsyncStorage Integration Complete**  
✅ **Version Conflicts Resolved**  
✅ **Error Handling Improved**  
✅ **Debugging Tools Added**

The app should now load without Firebase Auth errors and properly persist authentication state across app restarts.
